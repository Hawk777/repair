Looks like the local wildlife has gotten jumbled up! Your job is to defuse the situation by unfusing these creatures. Our patented solvents are here to help you resolve the situation: use Blue Fusion to combine animals and Purple Fission to gently separate them (available at refill stations). But watch out - neighbouring aliens have also taken an interest, and they're none too friendly.

It's too bad your spray nozzle is out of order - but maybe, if you swerve in just the right way...

GOAL: Save five animals.

CONTROLS: move with arrow keys / drift with Left Shift
